# AirQuality Prediction-Team 5
- Air Quality Prediction (Environmental AI) 
- Objective: Implement a time-series model (e.g., LSTM) to forecast air quality using sensor data (e.g., EPA Air Quality dataset). 
- Significance: Informs public health policies and urban planning, mitigating risks from poor air quality. 
- Skills Developed: Time-series forecasting, sensor data integration, ethical public health considerations.
