# Wildfire-Prediction-Team5
Wildfire risk prediction using satellite and climate data.
The Wildfire Prediction Model project tasks a team of three students with developing a machine learning model to predict wildfire risk using satellite imagery and climate data, such as NASAâ€™s FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) or NOAA datasets. The project focuses on integrating spatial and temporal features to forecast wildfire likelihood, leveraging models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Students will preprocess heterogeneous data (e.g., satellite images, temperature, humidity), train and optimize a predictive model, and visualize results for public or policymaker use. Ethical considerations, such as avoiding false alarms and ensuring equitable risk assessment across regions, are critical. Deliverables include a reproducible codebase, a trained model, a comprehensive report, and a demo showcasing wildfire risk maps. This project addresses real-world environmental challenges, preparing students for careers in climate-focused AI applications.
